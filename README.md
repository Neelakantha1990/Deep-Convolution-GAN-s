# Deep-Convolution-GAN-s
Created Images using Generator and trained Discriminiator to identify real and fake images
CIFAR-10 Datset with Multiple batches was passed through the Neural Networks of Generator

Steps followed:-

Designed  DCGANâ€™s to classify image(includes fake ones generated by Generator and real images of the dataset)  category accurately 
with Discriminator loss of 0.9% to Generator loss of 5.4%
